// located in.  Then, the modulation angle is normalized to the current
// 60 degree sector.  Two angles are calculated from the normalized 
// angle.  These two angles determine the times for the T1 and T2
// vectors.  The T1 and T2 vectors are then scaled by the modulation
// amplitude and the duty cycle range.  Finally, the T0 vector time
// is the time left over in the PWM counting period.
// The SVM() function then calculates three duty cycle values based
// on the T0, T1, and T2 times.  The duty cycle calculation depends
// on the 
// appropriate duty cycle values depending on the type of SVM to be
// generated.
